# nvim

This is my neovim configuration. Features include full support for the following
languages (among others!)

- rust
- go
- c, c++
- ocaml
- python
- typescript + any web dev
- haskell

This config is based on AstroNvim with a large number of other custom plugins.
Full OCaml support is available with a custom LSP configuration! The statusline
and winbar are based off NvChad and VSCode respectively. I plan on adding images
below at some point.
